# Car Detailing Jobs Scheduler

Running a car detailing business is by no means a walk in the park. Business owners constantly have to juggle 
between multiple appointments, ensuring each car to be detailed gets the attention it deserves, and managing 
their detailing staff efficiently. To ease these burdens, a Task Scheduler Application would be an ideal 
investment.

This repository contains a Task Scheduler App created for a local Car Detailing Service. The app leverages
the robust capabilities of Django to provide an easier means of managing bookings by business owners on the
backend and the flexibility of React, in creating a seamless experience for customers while making bookings
on the front end.
